# TicTacToe

This project is a simple implementation of the classic Tic-Tac-Toe game in Pascal using the `crt` unit for basic console manipulation.

## Features

- **Two-player game**: Players take turns to input their moves.
- **Win detection**: The game detects when a player has won.
- **Tie detection**: The game detects when the game is a tie (i.e., all cells are filled and no player has won).

## Requirements

- **Pascal Compiler**: You need a Pascal compiler such as Free Pascal (FPC) to compile and run this program.
- **CRT Unit**: The `crt` unit is used for console screen manipulation.

## How to Run

1. **Clone the repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/TicTacToe.git
   ```
   
2. **Navigate to the project directory**:
   ```bash
   cd TicTacToe
   ```
   
3. **Compile the program**:
   ```bash
   fpc TicTacToe.pas
   ```
   
4. **Run the compiled program**:
   ```bash
   ./TicTacToe
   ```

## How to Play

1. The game starts by displaying the empty board.
2. Player X goes first. Enter your move in the format `row, column` (e.g., `1,2`).
3. The board updates to reflect the move.
4. Player O goes next. Enter your move in the same format.
5. The game continues until there is a winner or the board is full (a tie).

## Code Overview

The main parts of the code include:

- **InitializeBoard**: Initializes the game board to empty spaces.
- **DisplayBoard**: Displays the current state of the board.
- **GetPlayerInput**: Gets the current player's move.
- **CheckForWin**: Check if the current player has won the game.
- **PlayGame**: The main game loop that alternates turns between the players and checks for win/tie conditions.
